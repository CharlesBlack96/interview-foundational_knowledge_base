        "In Big O notation, an algorithm's time complexity is expressed as the upper bound of its growth rate, which is denoted by \"O\". This growth rate is typically described in terms of the number of input elements, often represented as \"n\". The notation \"O(f(n))\" means that the algorithm's time complexity is proportional to some function of \"n\", with a scaling factor that is bounded above by a constant multiple of that function as \"n\" becomes very large.\n",

        "For example, an algorithm that takes constant time to complete, regardless of the input size, is said to have a time complexity of O(1). An algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n) has a linear growth rate, meaning that its runtime increases proportionally to the number of input elements. An algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) has a quadratic growth rate, meaning that its runtime increases quadratically as the input size increases.\n",
